# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards_Challenge
Built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Javascript with Plotly.js was used to build the interactive dashboard, which contains the following:
 - a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
 - a bubble chart that displays each sample.
 - the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
The plots above updates any time that a new sample is selected (via a dropdown).
